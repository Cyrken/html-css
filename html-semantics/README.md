# HTML semantics

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the coding language used to describe the content of websites.

HTML has no look—it’s only purpose is to describe the meaning, the semantics, of the content.

## HTML is plain text

HTML documents aren’t anything special, they’re just plain old text files. So plain and old that you could open an HTML file on a computer from the 70s.

The only thing that turns a plain text HTML file into a website is the web browser. The browser takes that text, parses it, figures out what the tags are that you’ve chosen and displays the website.

## HTML syntax

When writing HTML, the tags used to define the purpose of the text follow a specific syntax.

![]()

- `element` — the combination of an open tag, the content, and a close tag
- `open tag` — the part to an element that defines where this type of content starts
- `close tag` — the part of an element that defines where this type of content ends
- `attribute` — a piece of metadata that isn’t usually visible in the browser but defines extra information about the element

## HTML document setup

To create a valid HTML document we need to put some default code into the file.

Here’s what an empty HTML document looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-ca">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title></title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` — The first line of every HTML document should be the doctype. It tells the browser that you’re writing modern HTML.
- `<html>` — Wraps the whole HTML file, everything goes inside it.
- `<head>` — Stuff that doesn’t necessarily show on the screen, but controls and defines the HTML document.
- `<meta>` — Used to tell the browser what kind of characters are used in your document. `utf-8` allows many languages in the world.
- `<title>` — The piece of text that’s shown in the tab of your browser. Also shown in search results as the link.
- `<body>` — Not the body of the website, but the body of the HTML document. Everything rendered on the screen in a website goes in here.

*All the HTML elements listed below go inside the `<body>`.*

## HTML elements

Each HTML elements as a very specific purpose, here’s a bunch of them.
