# Float & clear

Float removes an element from the standard flow the browser uses to render websites.

- Any text in nearby elements will wrap around the floated element.
- Any block level elements, that come after the floated element in the HTML, will go up behind the floated element as though it wasn't there.

The primary purpose of `float` is for wrapping text around images,
but we can use it to make complex multi-column layouts.

## Clear

Clearing allows us to tell specific elements on the page to be displayed below floated elements.
