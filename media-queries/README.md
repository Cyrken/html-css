# Media queries

Media queries allow us to change our layouts and designs based on the browser.
We can change our layouts based on width, height, DPI, orientation, and lots more.

When creating our media queries it’s always best to use em-based media queries.
It helps us to not think in device specific widths and concentrate more on our content.

## Calculating em-based media queries

1. Get the width of the screen in pixels, using developer tools
2. Get your default font-size, set on your HTML element; it should be 16 px
3. Divide them: 500 px screen width ÷ 16 = 31.25
4. I usually round that number to something nice like 30 em

## Larger screens

On larger screens we want to capitalize on the greater horizontal real estate by making multi-column layouts.
And it’s always beneficial to bump up our font sizes.
